# Self-study for web development:

I'm making up this sylabus because a number of friends have been asking me what they should learn if they'd like to get a job as a web developer. Here's a rough outline of the basics. I will keep it up to date and add more resources as I find them. Feel free to suggest aditions.

## Extras:
 ### Podcasts to keep your motivation up when staring out:

Beginner focused. (often with guests who taught themselves to code). I suggest going through the backlogs and finding some that seem similar to your situation/interests:
* [Code Newbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)
* [Learn To Code With Me](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/)
* [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)
	
More general. You probably won't understand much at first, but you'll learn by osmosis and start to get a feel for new technologies and their life-cycles etc.: 
* [Software engineering daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/Podcast/) 
* [List of other good podcasts](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-podcasts-for-programmers-and-budding-developers/)
